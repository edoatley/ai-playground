# Building a Spring Boot Application with Gemini for an Agentic Experience

This document outlines a plan to build a Spring Boot application that uses the Gemini API to provide an agentic experience for users. The goal is to create a small, focused demo application that can be built in 1-2 weeks, showcasing how AI can add value to software applications.

## Concept: The "Smart Content Suggester"

The application will allow users to input a topic or a few keywords, and it will use Gemini to:

1. Generate relevant sub-topics or related ideas.
2. Draft a short introductory paragraph or outline for content (e.g., a blog post or presentation) based on the selected idea.

This demonstrates Gemini's ability to brainstorm, expand on ideas, and generate initial content, showcasing its value as a creative or productivity assistant.

## Core Technologies

- **Backend**: Spring Boot (Java)
- **AI**: Google Gemini API (using the official Google AI client library for Java)
- **Frontend**: Thymeleaf (for simple server-side rendered HTML) or basic REST endpoints with simple JavaScript/HTML. This plan uses Thymeleaf for simplicity.
- **Build Tool**: Maven or Gradle

## Step-by-Step Plan (Approx. 1-2 Weeks):

### Week 1: Core Setup & Basic Gemini Integration

1. **Project Setup (Day 1)**:
    - Use Spring Initializr (start.spring.io) to create a new Spring Boot project.
    - Dependencies: Spring Web, Thymeleaf, Lombok (optional, for cleaner DTOs/Models).
    - Add the Google AI Generative Language client library dependency to your pom.xml or build.gradle.

    ```xml
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.google.cloud</groupId>
        <artifactId>google-cloud-vertexai</artifactId>
        <version>LATEST_VERSION</version>
    </dependency>
    ```

    (Note: You might use com.google.ai.client.generativeai or similar depending on the specific library version/focus - check Google's official documentation for the recommended Java library for Gemini).
    - Set up basic project structure as outlined above.

2. **API Key Setup (Day 1)**:
    - Obtain a Gemini API key from Google AI Studio or Google Cloud Console.
    - Crucially: Do not hardcode the API key in your source code. Store it securely. For this demo, you can put it in application.properties (google.api.key=YOUR_API_KEY) but make sure this file is in your .gitignore and not committed to version control. For slightly better practice even in a demo, use environment variables.

3. **Basic Frontend (Day 2)**:
    - Create index.html using Thymeleaf.
    - Include a simple form with:
        - A text area for the user to input their main topic/keywords (id="topicInput").
        - A submit button.
    - Create results.html (initially empty or with placeholders) to display the output.

4. **Controller & DTOs (Day 2-3)**:
    - Create SuggestionController.java.
        - @GetMapping("/"): Method to display index.html.
        - @PostMapping("/suggest"): Method to handle the form submission.
    - Create SuggestionRequest.java DTO with a String topic field.
    - Create SuggestionResponse.java DTO with fields like List<String> relatedIdeas and String draftedContent.

5. **Gemini Service (Day 3-4)**:
    - Create GeminiService.java.
    - Inject the API key from configuration (@Value("${google.api.key}")).
    - Initialize the Gemini client (e.g., GenerativeModel from the Google library). Refer to the official Java client library documentation.
    - Create a method like generateContent(String prompt) that:
        - Takes a text prompt.
        - Sends the prompt to the Gemini API.
        - Handles potential API errors (basic try-catch for now).
        - Returns the generated text content.

6. **Suggestion Service & Basic Logic (Day 4-5)**:
    - Create SuggestionService.java.
    - Inject GeminiService.
    - Create a method getRelatedIdeas(String topic):
        - Construct a prompt for Gemini, e.g., "Brainstorm 5 distinct sub-topics or related ideas based on the main topic: " + topic.
        - Call geminiService.generateContent() with the prompt.
        - Parse the response (e.g., split by newline) into a list of strings.
    - Wire this up in the SuggestionController: The POST method should call suggestionService.getRelatedIdeas(), populate the SuggestionResponse DTO, add it to the Model, and return the results.html view name.
    - Update results.html to display the list of related ideas using Thymeleaf's th:each.

7. **End-to-End Test (Day 5)**: Run the application, enter a topic, and see if related ideas are generated and displayed. Debug as needed.

### Week 2: Refinement & Second Feature

1. **Implement Content Drafting (Day 6-7)**:
    - Modify the frontend (results.html): Add buttons next to each suggested idea ("Draft Intro").
    - Modify SuggestionController: Add a new POST mapping (e.g., /draft) that takes the original topic and the selected related idea.
    - Modify SuggestionService: Add a method draftContent(String topic, String selectedIdea):
        - Construct a suitable prompt, e.g., "Write a short, engaging introductory paragraph (approx 50-100 words) for content about '{selectedIdea}' which is related to the main topic '{topic}'."
        - Call geminiService.generateContent().
        - Return the drafted text.
    - Update the controller to call this service method and update the SuggestionResponse (perhaps adding the draft to it).
    - Update results.html to display the drafted content when it's available.

2. **Prompt Engineering & Refinement (Day 8)**:
    - Experiment with different prompts for both idea generation and drafting to improve the quality and relevance of Gemini's output. Make prompts clearer and more specific.
    - Consider adding instructions about the desired output format if needed.

3. **Error Handling & UX (Day 9)**:
    - Improve error handling in GeminiService (catch specific exceptions from the client library).
    - Display user-friendly error messages on the frontend if the API call fails or returns unexpected results (e.g., "Sorry, could not generate suggestions at this time.").
    - Maybe add a simple loading indicator (e.g., using basic JavaScript) while waiting for the API response.
    - Add basic CSS (style.css) to make the UI cleaner.

4. **Code Cleanup & Testing (Day 10)**:
    - Add comments to your code.
    - Refactor where necessary.
    - Write basic unit tests for the service layer (you can mock the GeminiService).
    - Perform thorough manual testing of the application flow.

5. **Documentation (Optional - Day 10)**: Write a short README.md explaining what the app does, how to set it up (mentioning API key env variable), and how to run it.

## Key Considerations

- **API Costs**: Gemini API usage may incur costs. Monitor your usage in the Google Cloud Console.
- **Rate Limiting**: Be aware of API rate limits. Implement retries or backoff strategies if needed (likely overkill for this small demo).
- **Security**: Never commit API keys. Use environment variables or a proper secrets management solution in a real application. The .gitignore approach is the minimum for a demo.
- **Gemini Model**: Choose the appropriate Gemini model (e.g., gemini-pro for text generation). Configure this in your GeminiService.
- **Synchronous Calls**: For simplicity, this plan uses synchronous calls. For a real-world app, consider asynchronous processing (CompletableFuture, Project Reactor) to avoid blocking web threads during API calls.

This plan outlines a feasible project for 1-2 weeks, resulting in a working Spring Boot application that clearly demonstrates how Gemini can be integrated to provide valuable AI-driven features like brainstorming and content generation. Good luck!
